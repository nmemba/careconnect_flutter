### CI/CD Integration

#### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
name: E2E Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Install Maestro
        run: brew install maestro
      
      - name: Start Simulator
        run: xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 14"
      
      - name: Build Flutter App
        run: flutter build ios --simulator
      
      - name: Run E2E Tests
        run: maestro test maestro/
      
      - name: Upload Reports
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: maestro-reports
          path: maestro/reports/
```

### Accessibility Testing Best Practices

1. **Screen Reader Testing**
   - Enable screen reader before running tests
   - Verify all interactive elements are announced
   - Check that content is in logical reading order
   - Ensure form fields have associated labels

2. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - All functionality must be accessible via keyboard
   - Tab order should be logical
   - All buttons and links should be keyboard accessible
   - Modal dialogs should trap focus

3. **Visual Accessibility**
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA minimum 4.5:1)
   - Text must be resizable
   - Don't rely on color alone to convey information
   - Support high contrast mode

4. **Motor Accessibility**
   - Touch targets should be at least 44x44 points
   - Forms should support auto-fill
   - Avoid time-sensitive interactions
   - Provide alternative input methods

### Test Coverage

| Flow | Coverage | Critical | Accessibility |
|------|----------|----------|---|
| Login | High | Yes | Yes |
| Medications | High | Yes | Yes |
| Appointments | High | Yes | Yes |
| Refills | Medium | Yes | Yes |
| Settings | High | Yes | Yes |

### Troubleshooting

#### Test Hangs on Startup
```bash
# Verify Flutter build
flutter build apk
# Or for iOS
flutter build ios --simulator
```

#### Device Not Found
```bash
# List available devices
maestro device list

# Start specific device
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 14"
```

#### Flaky Tests
- Increase wait times in test YAML
- Add retry configuration
- Check device performance
- Review logs: `maestro logs`

#### Screen Reader Not Working
```bash
# Enable accessibility in settings
# iOS: Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver
# Android: Settings > Accessibility > TalkBack
```

### Performance Metrics

Expected test durations:
- Single flow: 30-60 seconds
- All flows: 5-10 minutes
- With video recording: Add 50% time

### Best Practices

1. **Test Organization**
   - Group related tests
   - Use descriptive names
   - Add comments explaining complex flows

2. **Maintenance**
   - Keep element IDs stable
   - Update tests when UI changes
   - Version control test changes
   - Document known flakiness

3. **Reporting**
   - Generate reports in CI/CD
   - Archive reports for analysis
   - Monitor test trends
   - Alert on failures

### Advanced Configuration

#### Custom Wait Strategies
```yaml
- waitForAnimationToEnd:
    timeout: 5000

- waitForElementWithText:
    text: "Expected Text"
    timeout: 3000
```

#### Conditional Logic
```yaml
- tapOn:
    id: "button"

- runFlow: "nested_flow"

- assertVisible:
    id: "expected_element"
```

#### Data-Driven Testing
```yaml
- runFlow: "test_template"
  with:
    medication_name: "Aspirin"
    dosage: "500mg"
```
